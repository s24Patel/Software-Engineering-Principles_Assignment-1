# Broken Down Requirements

1. Improving Employee Onboarding

- Reduce the time it takes to fully train a new employee (currently 3 months).

- Create training materials like guides, checklists, or videos to help new employees.


2. Making Client Onboarding Easier

- Standardize how employees onboard new clients so it is done the same way each time.
- Simplify the process so clients do not get confused.
- Develop a clear set of instructions for both employees and clients.


3. Enhancing Overall Experience

- Reduce frustration for owners, employees, and clients.
- Ensure everyone knows what to do during onboarding.
- Provide a way to collect feedback to improve the process over time.
