# Assignment #1: Getting Organized


# Purpose:

- This document is to help us prepare for our first meeting with the client. We need to understand their needs, ask the right questions, and determine how to make their onboarding process easier. 


# Broken Down Requirements:

1. Improving Employee Onboarding

- Reduce the time it takes to fully train a new employee (currently 3 months).
- Make a step-by-step process for training so every new employee learns the same way.
- Create training materials like guides, checklists, or videos to help new employees.


2. Making Client Onboarding Easier

- Standardize how employees onboard new clients so it is done the same way each time.
- Simplify the process so clients do not get confused.
- Develop a clear set of instructions for both employees and clients.


3. Enhancing Overall Experience

- Reduce frustration for owners, employees, and clients.
- Ensure everyone knows what to do during onboarding.
- Provide a way to collect feedback to improve the process over time.


# Assumptions:

1. The client wants a digital solution to streamline onboarding.
2. The onboarding process currently lacks documentation and standard procedures.
3. Employees have different ways of onboarding clients due to a lack of clear guidelines.
4. Customers find the onboarding process confusing due to unclear instructions.
5. A self-service option for clients may help reduce workload for employees.

1. Can you explain how you currently onboard new employees?
2. What are the biggest challenges in training new employees?
3. What key information should every new employee know?
4. How do you train employees to onboard clients?
5. What steps do clients have to complete during onboarding?
6. What issues have clients reported about the onboarding process?
7. Are there any rules or regulations we need to follow?
